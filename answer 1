As I do not have access to citadel, I cannot guess properly.The files related to a subject are updated every semester.They would be updated when the students have vactions or after the exams.So no one will be accessing those files.While a large no. students will access it just before exams.So aption(a) seems to be better.As when server will have least load from students it can easilly unzip ,update and zip the files again.
